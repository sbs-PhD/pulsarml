# Pulsar ML

There are four Machine Learning models discussed here:

1. Adaboost
2. Gradient Boosting Classifier(GBC)
3. Neural Network
4. eXtreme Gradient BOOSTing(XGBoost)

These four models are trained in four iPyNB files present in the repo.

Each of the ipynb files contains separate sections. In each of them, only the first section concerns with training. Remaining all present confusion matrices, feature importances(in case of tree based methods), False Positive Rate analysis, area analysis and metric scores.
